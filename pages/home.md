# Kia Ora, I'm Ben Henshall

I'm a **backend software developer** living in London, United Kingdom. 

I've recently moved back to the UK and am looking for work.

If you've got any advice, connections, or would like to discuss an opportunity then please [get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-henshall). I'd be happy to hear from you.

## About this site

My little slice of the internet is powered by a custom Go application that turns hand-written markdown into static HTML and CSS.

It runs on Cloudflare Pages. I use GitHub Actions workflows to continuously integrate changes and deploy updates.
