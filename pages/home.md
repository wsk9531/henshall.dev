# Kia Ora, I'm Ben Henshall

I'm a **backend software developer** living in London, United Kingdom. 

> I've recently moved back to the UK and am looking for a new gig.
>
> If you've got any advice, connections, or would like to discuss an opportunity then please [get in touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-henshall). I'd be happy to hear from you.

## About me

I was born in the UK, but raised in Auckland, New Zealand. I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer and Information Sciences from Auckland University of Technology in 2021.

My professional focus has been on **event-driven services using modern Java** and **Kafka**. I enjoy working in domains that have a positive impact on people and the planet, most recently building out **data processing services** and **APIs** for a Health Intelligence Platform. I've also had some expsure to the **Python/Spark** ecosystem and would love to keep growing in web and data spaces. 

As far as quirky side projects go, I'm currently hacking on Quake 3 network packets to build useful utilities for the die-hard community. It has been a great excuse to pick up **Go** - Hope to share more on this soon!

My other hobbies are decidedly analogue. Earth is quite stunning and I deeply enjoy exploring it.

I also get a lot of personal satisfaction from musical pursuits. I love noodling on my guitars, catching as many gigs as I can, soldering effects pedals, and *slowly* improving at the piano.
